##Introduction
#####What is the IoT?
IoT stands for the Internet of Things, and it refers to the system of inter-connected computing devices that can collect and send data by themselves through the internet. Things in this context may be thermostats, smart home devices, and even cars. Since IoT products function without human intervention, things like smart phones would not count as an IoT product.
